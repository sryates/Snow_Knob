## Voron 0 Kirigami Bed Knobs. 
### The goal, to give the largest possible thumb wheels for easier leveling.
Better Knobs for Voron 0 and other Ants
By Discord User ZeroKune#3471 AKA "Erebus V0.1471"

After killing my thumbs for over a year (though not often), I decided my Voron 0 needed a better knob system that could fit within the space alloud.

Recomended use for Kirigami Beds

Once fitted they work as per normal no problems on the V0.2

# Introducing the Snow Knob.
why snow? Because winter is long and hard and it's still snowing in April and I wanted to immortalize it.

# Parts List 
3 M3x35 screws (don't be afraid to splurge on better quality ones like titanium on Kirigami Bed) or replace your existing with a good fresh M3x40 as they may bend over time.
3 M3 Heat inserts same kind as you used on the entire build for optimal fit you'll also want a flat surface to rub them on as they cool to ensure a straight fit.

## Relevel your Bed
I recomend using a 0.2 MM feeler guage get the nozzle just to the point where it touches the guage but doesn't hop and slides under with only a small resistance.

Enjoy!
